# 🛡️ VulnHub Walkthroughs by preetika-cyber

Welcome to my collection of VulnHub CTF walkthroughs. These writeups showcase my practical skills in penetration testing, including enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation.

Each walkthrough is a step-by-step report based on real-world simulated environments, using tools like Nmap, SQLmap, Burp Suite, Hydra, Metasploit, and custom scripts.
